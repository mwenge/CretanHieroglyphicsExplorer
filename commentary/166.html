before

 031 suggests that this last sign is the 
logogram *174.  See Inflection Sequence 2a.

 078-032 is unique to 
this inscription and appears twice, perhaps belonging to a single 
inflection system (see Inflection Sequence 2).

 c1: see Notes to Sign 
013, suggesting that

that is what the initial X that begins the next signgroup, the only 
initial X on the bar, implies.
