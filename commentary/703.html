 a: JGY: a heading; cf. PE Ha 
003.c:
 <img src="./commentary/images/H042.jpg"/>
 <img src="./commentary/images/H023.jpg"/>
 <img src="./commentary/images/H011.jpg"/>
 042-023-011. In the  Notes to Sign
 <img src="./commentary/images/H033.jpg"/>
 033, I suggest
that it (besides being a predecessor to A*47) represents a voiced dental
(Tv, Dv); if so,  then
 <img src="./commentary/images/H042.jpg"/>
 <img src="./commentary/images/H033.jpg"/>
 042-033 could join  the list of other occurrences of
 <i>
  A-TU
 </i>
 at Petras
(see note to PE Hh  016), with the alternative possibility of being a
spelling variation on  the more common
 <i>
  A-DE
 </i>
 heading in Hieroglyphic 
(cf. A-DU in Linear A).

 b: The ligatured sign looks
like
 <img src="./commentary/images/H042.jpg"/>
 042 as it sometimes appears as a mason's 
mark.
 <br/>
 b: JGY: The ligatured sign
 <img src="./commentary/images/PE_He_001_lig.jpg" width="50"/>
 looks 
like an abbreviated
 <img src="./commentary/images/H039.jpg"/>
 039 or an abbreviated and 
haftless
 <img src="./commentary/images/H042.jpg"/>
 042. As a ligature, it resembles 
Linear A
 <img src="./commentary/images/A566.jpg"/>
 *566 (086+188) or
 <img src="./commentary/images/A565.jpg"/>
 *565 (086+'188'). *566 employs 
the standard form of
 <img height="30" src="./commentary/images/A188.jpg"/>
 188 and occurs 
only by 
itself on KH roundels (Wc 2058-62). *565 employs a square version of 188 
and occurs 
on HT 8b.5, a commodity that is measured in a fraction (J, 1/2) and 
presumably is disbursed to PA-JA-RE, and on HT 26b.4 (7 units 
contributed?).
 <br/>
 JGY: It is 
remotely possible that the ligatured sign is Petras's way of writing &lt;--
