 a: CHIC: a vertical separation line is 
effaced below the first 100.  JGY: for the signgroup, see Notes to 
Signgroups X.  Since a separation bar was originally written, the 
signgroup may be a header. The number could be higher than

  250
 </b>

either in tens or in units - this break is the only one that allows for

 c: the number is probably
 <b>

430.

 d: the signgroup may be a variant of
